  Capture and analyse the Scooby-Doo recomp's audio (AX HLE mixer, ADPCM streams, output limiter, SDL backend)
  to root-cause crackle, clicks, fuzz, dropouts or wrong sounds. Use for any audio bug, before guessing at
  Windows settings, resamplers or buffer sizes.

# Audio debugging

The game's audio goes: DSP-ADPCM voices in ARAM → `AcceleratorT` decode (`hle/audio/ax_internal.h`) → per-voice
SRC (`ResampleAudio`, `ax_mix.cpp`) → mix at 32 kHz → `GcOutputSamples` (tanh soft limiter, knee 24576) →
`audio_backend.cpp` (SDL3 stream, drops whole blocks past a 120 ms queue). The HLE is ported from Dolphin, so a
bug there is often also in Dolphin HLE. Goal is a clean remaster, not matching Dolphin.

## Order of work

1. **Capture what the game mixed** (no SDL, no Windows): `AUDIO_RAW_DUMP=<file>` (built in) before
   `manual-session start` → BE16 stereo R/L, 32 kHz.
2. **Measure, don't just listen:** `python tools\debug\audio\crackle.py <dump> [--wav out.wav] [--from S --to S]`
   → 2nd-difference clicks, flat tops (clipping), zero gaps (drops), limiter-knee counts, per-second table, strongest
   clicks with frame numbers. Look for a **grid** in click times (a period = a buffer/loop size).
3. **Split by stage** with `tools\debug\patches\audio-diagnostic.patch` (`git apply`; env `AX_DIAG_DIR=<dir>`):
   - `bus.raw` pre-limiter MAIN L/R int32 (`--fmt bus`), `stream.raw` stream voice post-SRC, `stream_src.raw`
     stream voice as decoded (pre-SRC, source rate), `stream_pos.txt` per-frame stream address + `WRAP` lines
     (loop pred/scale vs ARAM header), `events.txt` (`B` voice start, `K` stopped, `E` ended, `S` depop, `C` stream
     coefs + ARAM bytes). Flushes about once a second, so killing the game keeps the data.
   - `AX_HEADROOM_DB=<n>` scales the bus before the limiter (overload test). Backend logs every `[drop]`.
4. **Check against the disc** (ground truth for "is it in the recording?"):
   `python tools\debug\audio\adpcm_ref.py Disc\DATA\files\boot.HIP --list` then
   `adpcm_ref.py boot.HIP <asset id> --compare <AX_DIAG_DIR>\stream_src.raw` → bit-exact or first differing sample.
5. Strip the patch (`git apply -R`) before a PR; re-capture with the fix-only build.

For music-only listening in the hubs, make sure no holiday fires: builds with PR #13 take `[game] holiday = "off"`; older
builds read the date 2000-01-01 (fireworks every load) unless they have PR #12 or `tools\debug\patches\real-date.patch`
(`NO100F_REAL_DATE=1`).

## Game facts

- Music = one ADPCM **stream** voice (`is_stream 1`, e.g. PB `8025EAF4` in `h002`), 48 kHz source (SNDI may say 47999),
  SRC ratio `0x17FFD`, `src_type 1` (linear). Ring buffer in ARAM refilled by the game; `h002` ring = 48,000 nibbles =
  0.875 s. The game never sets `adpcm_loop_info` (old AX lib, always 0).
- Tracks live in `boot.HIP` as `SNDS` assets (raw ADPCM frames, no header; names end `-L`). Coefficients etc. in the
  `SNDI` asset: u32 count, then per entry **[0x60-byte DSP header][u32 asset id]** — the id comes *after* its header
  (reading it as id-then-header gives the neighbour's coefs). `h002` music = `9974599F` "action loop 06-L".
- Level `SNDS` assets in level HIPs are voice lines, not music.
- `h002` = Mystic Playground (the reported crackle level).

## Traps

- Click detectors also flag drum hits; compare a before/after pair sample by sample (decode is deterministic,
  differences = the change) instead of trusting counts.
- Spectrograms hide few-ms cracks in busy music; zoom the waveform (30–40 ms) at a known event.
- Fireworks/SFX push the bus past the limiter knee (peaks ~41k pre-limiter) → fuzz that is not a decode bug.
- GitHub won't attach `.wav`/`.mp3`; post clips as `.mp4` (title card + audio). `gh` can't upload attachments —
  insert a placeholder section and have the human drag files in.
