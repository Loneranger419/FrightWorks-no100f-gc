  Root-cause gameplay, timing and simulation bugs in the Scooby-Doo recomp: things that behave differently at 60 fps
  ([video] fps60), particles that flicker, pop or double, objects in the wrong place, anything where the game's own
  state (not GPU state) goes wrong. Covers parking Scooby at a fixed spot (mkhip.py + F9 spots), reading/poking guest
  memory live (postool), counting particles per system/emitter, and measuring flicker from recordings.

# Game-logic / frame-rate debugging

GPU state bugs (wrong geometry, textures, blend) → `hle-divergence-debug`. This skill is for when the *game's* data is
what changes: positions, timers, spawn counts, pools. The usual cause in this port is a game loop that assumed 30 Hz.

## How fps60 works (and how it breaks things)

- `[video] fps60`: `VIGetRetraceCount` doubles the count for `lr == 0x800AD690`, so the main loop runs twice per 30 Hz frame
  and the game steps everything by the measured `dt` (half as large).
- Code that scales by `dt` is fine. Code that acts **per call** (emit N particles, add a fixed step, count frames) does it twice
  as often. Find the per-call site and make it run at the game's 30 Hz rate; don't touch the consumers.
- Fix pattern (PR #14, `hle/no100f_particles.cpp`): native override of the per-frame caller that accumulates `dt` per object
  and calls the original once the sum reaches 0.75/30 s, passing the summed `dt`. Gate on `RuntimeConfigFile::Fps60()` so 30 fps
  is byte-for-byte unchanged. A 30 fps frame (slowdown) still reaches the threshold alone.

## Order of work

1. **Measure the symptom** with a fixed view: park Scooby (below), record 6 s at fps60 on/off, `flashcount.py` each. Check
   Dolphin too (`hle-divergence-debug` step 5) — "Dolphin is smooth" separates port bugs from game bugs.
2. **Find the data**: postool `dump` MEM1, `findpos.py` for a known world position, `addrrefs.py` for code that builds an
   address, `dol.py callers/func` for who writes it. `trace ADDR N` follows a linked list per frame.
3. **Count, don't eyeball**: per-system pool use (`parsys.py`), per-emitter spawn rate at 30 vs 60 (`births-run.ps1` + `births.py`).
4. **Fix at the per-call site**, re-measure with the same tools (rates within noise of 30 fps, flash count 0), then human visual
   check + smoke boots.

## Parking Scooby at a fixed spot (`tools/debug/game/mkhip.py`)

Pick the scene from `tools/debug/game/levels.md` (scene IDs, level names, which scenes have torches/fog/rain/...).

The camera can't be turned, so a fixed spawn gives a fixed view. `mkhip.py` writes a patched level HIP into the `zz-manual`
boot mod that `manual-session start` creates (game data: local only).

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools\debug\manual-session.ps1 start -Boot i004 -AllPowerups   # writes zz-manual + Config
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools\debug\manual-session.ps1 stop
python tools\debug\game\mkhip.py i004 --spot spot1            # spawn there, all NPCs moved off-map (--npc none keeps them)
#   or: mkhip.py i004 --pos X Y Z --yaw R
Start-Process 'Play\Scooby-Doo Refrightened.exe' -WorkingDirectory Play   # not manual-session start: it rewrites zz-manual
```

- Spots: with `postool.patch` built in, **F9** (global hotkey) appends Scooby's position + yaw to `Play/postool/spots.txt`
  (beeps). Copy good ones to `tools/debug/game/spots.txt` (i004 grate spots are there). F9 saves the feet; mkhip adds 0.3 to Y.
- NPCs: clearing `baseFlags & 1` does nothing (NPC code ignores it), so mkhip moves them to (2000+50i, -500, 2000).
- Poking only Scooby's matrix doesn't stick (the frame rebuilds it); the dev menu's teleport (below) does, or use the spawn.
- Clean up afterwards: delete `Play\UserData\mods\zz-manual`, copy `tools\debug\local\Config.user.toml` back.

## Dev menu (`tools/debug/patches/devmenu.patch`, `no100f_devmenu.cpp`)

Run: `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools\debug\play-patched.ps1` applies the patch, builds, starts the game
and takes the patch out of the source when the game closes (`-SkipTranslate` only if the last build was this branch;
`-CleanBuild` rebuilds `Play\` without it afterwards; `-Keep` to work on the menu, then re-export the patch and `-Remove`).
`-HdTextures` plays with the HD texture pack like the release does (`texture_pack\ScoobyHD` linked into
`Play\UserData\texture_replacements`, `texture_replacements = true`; both put back afterwards). The user's config has HD off,
so a bug seen in the release but not in a dev build may be an HD texture: retry with `-HdTextures`.

**F8** in game: current scene + Scooby's position, go to any scene (start position), save/delete spots and go to them
(another scene loads first), god mode (no damage, green Scooby), Monsters tab (all off in every scene, or one
by one in this scene). Spots: `UserData/devmenu_spots.txt` (`I004 x y z yawRad name`). Scriptable through
`Play/devmenu.txt` (every 30 frames while in play, then deleted; results in `Play/devmenu.log`): `scene ID`, `spot NAME`,
`save NAME`, `tp X Y Z [YAWDEG]`, `where`, `peek ADDR [N]`, `frame`, `god on|off`, `monsters [on|off]` (list / all),
`monster N|NAME on|off`, `ents` (scene entity list), `textures`. Doesn't touch warp flags or the save file.

Textures tab (for HD pack audits): reads `UserData/devmenu_textures.txt` (tab-separated `id file severity asset scenes level`,
`#` comments) and lists those replacement textures per scene, each marked "drawn" once the game has used it since start
(aurora `aurora_texture_replacement_used(name)`, added by the patch: names are recorded when a replacement is looked up).
Each row can save a spot named after the ID or go to it; suspects whose scenes include `boot` count in every scene.
Find (row button or `find <id>`) draws that replacement solid magenta and writes each distinct GX state it is drawn with to
`Play\devmenu_drawstate.txt` (needs `texture_replacements = true` and a pack file for the key).

Texture log ("Log every texture" checkbox, or env `NO100F_TEXLOG=1` at start): the first draw of each texture key with
each distinct sampler + GX state in each scene appends a row to `Play\devmenu_texlog.csv` (scene, key, replacement, texmap,
size, wrap, filters, mips/LODs, alpha compare, blend, z test/func/write, z-before-tex, colour/alpha write, uploaded size).
Disc textures without a pack file are logged too (every static texture is named at upload, `TextureRef::debugKey`).
Take it with HD on: aurora keeps palette (TLUT) mirrors only when `texture_replacements = true`, so with HD off every
C4/C8/C14X2 key gets a zero palette hash. Rows tagged `none` were drawn before the scene ID was set (boot, first frames).

- Scene switch = the game's portal path: write a portal + asset (+0x08 camera, +0x0C marker, +0x10 yaw deg, +0x14 scene ID)
  in a reserved page (0x816FF000, lowers the arena by 4 KB) and set the pending portal `[[0x80245CF4]+0x70]`. The scene
  update fades out (state 4), handler `0x800ACD30` (mode 0xB, state 5) loads it. Marker 0 = the scene's own start.
- Teleport: player entity frame `[0x802453C8]`: matrix (pos +0x30), previous pos +0x80, yaw angles +0xA4 and +0xC4; plus the
  model matrix `[[0x802453B4]+0x20]` and the camera target (0x801BD0A0/AC). Writing only the matrix gets rebuilt.
- In play = mode `[0x80270E18]` 0xB and state `[0x802703C8]` 1. Current scene ID `[[0x80245CF4]+0x6C]`.
- God mode: sd2.ini `TakeDamage` lives at `0x802459B4` (globals + 0x824) and is read on every hit (`0x8005A430`: health
  +0x2E8 -= damage only when nonzero); held at 0. Tint: player instances `[0x802453B4]` (+0 next, +0x10 RpAtomic), geometry
  `[atomic+0x18]`: flags +8 `|= 0x40` (modulate material colour), materials `[geom+0x20]` x `[geom+0x24]`, colour RGBA at
  `mat+4` (`0x78FF78FF` = green). Scooby has 12 atomics, one material each, all `FFFFFFFF`. Human-checked: no health
  lost, but the hit reaction (knockback animation + freeze) still plays; it isn't gated on TakeDamage.
- Monsters = base type 0x02 (NPC) in the scene list `[scene+0x78]` x `[scene+0x74]` (gang NPCs like SHAGGYRUN too).
  Entity: +0x10 asset (first word = ID), +0x2C model instances (+0x20 matrix), +0x30 update (null = the scene loop skips it),
  +0x40 frame, +0x4C bound centre. Off = update nulled + parked at (2000+50i, -500, 2000) every frame; on = restored. Names:
  the scene HIP's ADBG records (`files/<L>0/<id>.HIP`, type `NPC `). Human-checked: parked monsters can't hit or block.
- The game's own warp gates: table 0x801C68B0 (26 x {index, unlocked, scene}); unlock-all `0x8004C690` (only called by a
  blanked-out cheat). Pause map rooms (`E 05 SELECTED`) only pick the stats shown, they don't warp.

## postool (`tools/debug/patches/postool.patch`, `hle/vi.cpp`)

Every 20 main-loop frames it runs the lines in `Play/postool.txt`, then deletes the file; output in `Play/postool/`.

| Command | Output |
| --- | --- |
| `dump NAME` | MEM1 big-endian → `NAME.bin` (for `findpos.py`, `parsys.py`) |
| `peek ADDR [N]` | N words → `peek.txt` |
| `poke ADDR HEX...` | write words (floats as hex) |
| `trace ADDR N` | N frames of the list whose head is `[ADDR]`: length + first 4 particles → `trace.txt` |
| `births SECONDS` | particle births + birth speed per owner emitter asset → `births.txt` (`p1`/`p2` tags only with probe lines in the overrides) |

## Measuring flicker (`tools/debug/capture/`)

- `record.ps1 -Out x.mp4 [-Seconds 6] [-Toggle]`: gdigrab of the game's client rect (window capture of the swapchain is black).
  `-Toggle` holds `Play/fogstat.txt` for the duration (for `fogstat-probes.patch`).
- `flashcount.py x.mp4`: drops duplicate frames, counts cells in the lower half that jump >3 for exactly one frame.
- `triplet.py x.mp4 K out.png [box]`: frames K-1/K/K+1 + amplified difference, to see what flashed.

## Game facts

- **Particles**: one pool, 2000 × 0x50 at `0x80210858..0x80237958`. Particle: +0 next, +4 prev, +8 life left, +0xC colour,
  +0x10 pos, +0x1C size, +0x20 vel, +0x3C owner (emitter asset in RAM; first word = asset ID).
  - Systems: pointer array at `0x80237958`; system +0 list head, +8 count, +0x11 priority, +0x12 flags.
  - Allocator `fn_80032728`: free list (`fn_800325C8`); when empty it **steals the head particle of a lower-priority system**.
    Pool exhaustion shows up as the lowest-priority effect (i004 floor fog, priority 0) losing particles.
  - Emit `fn_800C4B04(emitter r3, dt f1)`: timer at +0x1C; when ≤ 0 emits `asset+0xA` ± `asset+0xB` and resets to `asset+0xC`.
    Interval 0 = emits on **every call** (256 of 433 disc emitters; mostly one-shots).
  - Callers: `fn_800C4AAC` per-frame update (pause check `fn_800AD3B4`, enabled bit +0x18; called from `fn_800CE760`) —
    fixed by PR #14. `fn_800C5C0C` "emit with overrides", 89 entity-code callers — `fix/particles-fps60-path2` (`fog-pr14.md`).
  - Emit sets particle velocity = asset velocity x dt; MOVE adds it every frame (no dt). So dt passed to emit must be the
    real frame time: a summed or fixed 1/30 dt doubles particle speed at 60 fps. `births` prints `speed` to check this.
- **HIP assets** (`audio/hip.py` lists, `game/mkhip.py` has an `assets()` walker): xEntAsset pos at +0x1C; PLYR yaw at +0x10.
  PARE +9 type, +0xA count, +0xB variance, +0xC interval, +0x30 PARS ID. PARS +0xC parent, +0x16 maxPar.
- Scooby's model matrix (xMat4x3: right, up, at, pos) at `[0x802453C8]`; yaw = `atan2(at.x, at.z)`.
- `sd2.ini` in the boot mod sets `TakeDamage = 0` (`-AllPowerups` also unlocks gadgets).

## Traps

- `powershell -File script.ps1 -Levels a,b` passes ONE string `"a,b"`; a bad `BOOT=` crashes the game ("Missing indirect jump
  target"). `births-run.ps1` splits and validates; do the same in new scripts and abort on a `crash_*` file in the log dir.
- Wait for a level by polling the newest `Play/UserData/Logs/*/console.log` for `<level>.HIP`, not with fixed sleeps.
- At 60 fps the recorder sees each game frame ~twice; always compare unique frames.
