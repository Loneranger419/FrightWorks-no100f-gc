# Testing and dev tools

How to build FrightWorks yourself, run the tests, and use the debug tools to check a change or chase a bug. Everything
here is Windows 10/11 x64 and PowerShell, run from the repository root.

The tool reference (every script, one line each) is [`tools/debug/README.md`](../tools/debug/README.md); this page is
the walkthrough.

**Never commit game data:** no disc image, `Disc/`, extracted or dumped files, logs or recordings. `Disc/`, `Play/`,
`autotest/` and `tools/debug/local/` are git-ignored for that reason.

## 1. One-time setup

You need Python 3 and Git, plus your own **Night of 100 Frights, GameCube USA v1.01 (GIHE78, revision 1)** image. The
build downloads its own compiler, CMake and Ninja into `toolchain\` the first time.

```powershell
# Build the launcher and use it to extract your disc image into Disc\DATA
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools\build-launcher.ps1
& "launcher\publish\FrightWorks.exe" --extract "C:\path\to\game.iso" Disc\DATA

# First full build of the game (translates main.dol, then compiles) -> Play\
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools\build-no100f.ps1
```

The debug scripts also use Python packages: `pip install numpy pillow capstone` (`capstone` is for the disassembly
tools). Video capture needs ffmpeg on PATH, or run `tools\debug\capture\get-ffmpeg.ps1` once.

## 2. Build and play

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools\build-no100f.ps1 -SkipTools                  # full build
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools\build-no100f.ps1 -SkipTools -SkipTranslate   # faster: native code only
& "Play\FrightWorks Game.exe"
```

- Every build also puts the HD texture pack (`texture_pack\ScoobyHD`, downloaded from the Internet Archive by the first
  build, plus `tools\hd-pack-additions`) and the button prompt icons into `Play\UserData`,
  like a release (`tools\stage-userdata.ps1`; only what changed is copied or rebuilt). The icons need Python and
  ImageMagick; without them the build warns and goes on.
- `-SkipTools` skips the toolchain and dependency checks (fine once the first build has downloaded them).
- `-SkipTranslate` reuses the translated game code. Only use it when you changed native code (`wiicompiled/runtime`,
  `wiicompiled/aurora-main`). **Do a full build** (no `-SkipTranslate`) when you add or remove a native override
  (`PPC_NATIVE_OVERRIDE`), switch to a branch that does, or after any build with a debug patch that adds overrides
  (the dev menu does). Otherwise the game stops at boot with "Fatal Error" and PC=0.
- Settings, saves and mods are in `Play\UserData\` (`Config.toml`; in game **F10**, **F11** fullscreen).
- Packaging a release zip: `tools\package-scooby.ps1 -Build -Zip` → `dist\`. It also needs ImageMagick (`magick`) on
  PATH and the HD texture pack in `texture_pack\ScoobyHD` (not in git).

## 3. Unit tests

The tests are CMake targets in `wiicompiled/runtime/CMakeLists.txt`; the game build doesn't build them. After a game
build has created `wiicompiled\native-build`:

```powershell
$tc = "$PWD\toolchain"; $env:PATH = "$tc\llvm-mingw\bin;$tc\Ninja;$tc\CMake\bin;$env:PATH"
cmake --build wiicompiled\native-build --parallel          # builds everything, tests included
ctest --test-dir wiicompiled\native-build --output-on-failure
```

One test: `cmake --build wiicompiled\native-build --target <name>`, then run `wiicompiled\native-build\<name>.exe`.
New pure logic (no SDL, no guest memory) belongs in a header with a test next to the existing ones.

## 4. Playtest a level

`tools\debug\manual-session.ps1` opens one game window straight into a level, for looking at a bug and taking
screenshots.

Every test runs with the same settings (windowed 1600x900, 60 fps, MSAA 4, HD pack off unless `-HdTextures`), not
yours. `start` saves your own settings first (`Play\UserData\Config.toml` and the `*.controller` files where F10
controller remaps are kept) to `tools\debug\local\user-setup\`, and `stop` puts them back and deletes the
`Play\UserData\mods\zz-manual` boot mod. If a test didn't finish, the saved copy stays (a new test keeps it rather than
saving the test settings over it); `restore` puts it back.

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools\debug\manual-session.ps1 start -Boot i001 -AllPowerups
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools\debug\manual-session.ps1 shot -Label curtains   # -> autotest\manual\
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools\debug\manual-session.ps1 stop                   # your settings back
```

- `-Boot <scene>` picks the level (default `e001`); `-AllPowerups` unlocks every gadget; `-HdTextures` turns the HD pack
  on. Scene IDs, level names and which scenes suit which tests: [`tools/debug/game/levels.md`](../tools/debug/game/levels.md),
  or `python tools\debug\game\levels.py i004`. Common ones: `h001` (hub, smoke test), `i001`, `i004` (boot it directly),
  `e001`.
- `status` shows the running session; `stop-tests` kills leftover automation.
- Settings not in the generated config, or launching the game yourself (e.g. to capture its stderr): run `prepare`
  (same options as `start`; saves your settings, writes the config and boot mod, doesn't start the game), add your
  section to `Config.toml`, launch the exe, and `stop` when done (`shot` captures any running game). Example:
  `tools\debug\holiday-shots.ps1`. The other scripts in `tools\debug` that start the game do the same.
- Don't run several game windows or level-sweep automation for visual bugs: one window, looked at by a person.

## 5. Dev menu (F8)

The dev menu is part of the game, off unless **Extras > Developer tools** is on in the launcher (`[game] dev_tools =
true` in `Config.toml`) or `NO100F_DEV_TOOLS=1` is set; the scripts in `tools/debug` set that variable for their
sessions. With it on, the game shows **DEV** and its build in the bottom-right corner. `play-patched.ps1` builds,
starts the game with the dev menu on and, for branches from before the dev menu was built in, applies
`tools/debug/patches/devmenu.patch` and takes it out again when you close the game:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools\debug\play-patched.ps1              # dev menu
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools\debug\play-patched.ps1 -HdTextures  # with the HD pack, like the release
```

In game, **F8**: current level and Scooby's position, go to any level (Levels tab), save spots and go back to them, god mode,
monsters off (all or one by one), power-ups on/off (all at once or one by one), a Textures tab (find a texture, mark it), an Effects tab and a free camera. Spots are
saved in `Play\UserData\devmenu_spots.txt`. Travel is one transfer at a time: asked for while paused or in a
cutscene, it waits for normal play (**Cancel travel** drops it). **Skip** presses the game's own skip button for a
recorded cutscene (A) or the title intro / attract demo (Start). More commands (scripted through `Play\devmenu.txt`) are in the
`game-logic-debug` skill.

The Textures and Effects tabs list textures from `Play\UserData\devmenu_textures.txt`, one per line, tab-separated:
`id  file  severity  asset  scenes  level  [effect]` (`scenes` space-separated, `boot` = every scene; `#` starts a
comment). Lines whose seventh column starts with `effect` go on the Effects tab: textures drawn at runtime (bonks,
pickups, particles), not a switch for gameplay effects. Edit the file while the game runs and press **Reload**. The
free camera turns itself off when the scene changes.

Options: `-Patch devmenu,postool` (several patches), `-CleanBuild` (rebuild `Play\` without the patch afterwards),
`-Keep` (leave it applied to work on it; re-export the patch afterwards), `-Remove` (take the patches out if the
window was closed instead of the game), `-SkipTranslate` (only if the last build was from the same branch with the
same patches), `-NoBuild` (play what's in `Play\`).

A dev-menu build of another branch: `tools\debug\texhunt\build-devmenu.ps1 -Branch <branch>`, then
`play-patched.ps1 -NoBuild` (branches with the built-in dev menu are built as they are). The patch is only for older
branches now; change the dev menu in `wiicompiled/runtime/src/no100f_devmenu.cpp`.

**On an older branch, after a dev-menu patch build the next normal build must be a full build** (no `-SkipTranslate`),
or use `-CleanBuild`.

Every build knows what it was built from: the F10 **About** page, the DEV mark and the first lines of `console.log`
show the version and, for a test build, `branch@commit` plus `+xxxx` when it had uncommitted changes (a hash of
them, so two builds with different edits differ).

## 6. Other diagnostic patches

`tools/debug/patches/` holds diagnostics that never go into a fix PR. Apply them with `play-patched.ps1 -Patch <name>`
(or `git apply`, and `git apply -R` before committing). The table with what each one does is in
[`.claude/skills/manual-yn-bisect/strip-before-pr.md`](../.claude/skills/manual-yn-bisect/strip-before-pr.md). The most
useful:

| Patch | What it adds |
| --- | --- |
| `devmenu` | F8 dev menu for branches from before it was built in (above) |
| `postool` | Live memory: write `dump NAME`, `peek ADDR [N]` or `poke ADDR HEX...` lines to `Play\postool.txt` (run every 20 frames, output in `Play\postool\`); **F9** saves Scooby's position to `Play\postool\spots.txt` |
| `audio-diagnostic` | Per-stage audio dumps (`AX_DIAG_DIR`) |
| `real-date` | Real clock for old builds that always start on 2000-01-01 |

## 7. Logs, scripted input and other switches

- **Logs**: `Play\UserData\Logs\<time>\console.log`; the newest one shows which level files load (`[dvdread] ...
  xNNN.HIP`). Runtime messages (`RT_LOGF`) go to stderr: launch with
  `Start-Process "Play\FrightWorks Game.exe" -WorkingDirectory Play -RedirectStandardError err.txt`.
- **Scripted input** (no controller needed): set `NSMBW_INPUT_SCRIPT` before starting the game, e.g.
  `$env:NSMBW_INPUT_SCRIPT = '10000:PLUS,12000:DOWN,13500:A'` = press Start at 10 s, D-pad down at 12 s, A at 13.5 s
  (ms after the game first reads input; optional third field = hold time in ms, default 150). Buttons: `A`, `B`,
  `PLUS` (Start), `ONE` (X), `TWO` (Y), `MINUS` (Z), `UP`/`DOWN`/`LEFT`/`RIGHT`.
- **Button prompts**: `$env:BUTTON_ICONS = 'xbox'` (or `playstation`, `nintendo`) forces a prompt set; the game puts
  the prompt picture together from one icon per pad button, following player 1's mapping. The icons are built by
  `python tools\make-button-icons.py --out Play\UserData\button_icons` (needs ImageMagick and the HD pack).
- **Audio capture**: `$env:AUDIO_RAW_DUMP = 'C:\temp\out.raw'` writes the mixed output; analysis tools in
  `tools\debug\audio\`.
- Remove test variables afterwards: `Remove-Item Env:NO100F_*, Env:AX_*, Env:NSMBW_*, Env:AUDIO_*, Env:BUTTON_ICONS -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue`.
- **Launcher screenshots** without opening it: `& "launcher\publish\FrightWorks.exe" --shots <dir>`
  draws every page to `<dir>\<Page>.png`.
- **Screen recording**: `tools\debug\capture\record.ps1`.

## 8. Looking at the game's code and data

- `python tools\debug\dol.py func 8000F5E8` disassembles a function of `main.dol`; `callers <addr>`, `dis <addr> <n>`,
  `name <addr>` (needs `capstone`).
- `python tools\debug\overrides.py` lists the native overrides (functions the port replaces).
- `tools\debug\game\addrrefs.py LO HI` finds code that builds an address in a range.
- `tools\debug\audio\hip.py` lists the assets in a level file (`Disc\DATA\files\*.HIP`).
- Dolphin is useful as a reference for what the game intends; compare against it rather than copying it.

## 9. Before you open a PR

- Fix-only: minimal diff, no diagnostics (revert any patch: `play-patched.ps1 -Remove -Patch <name>` or `git apply -R`),
  no unrelated changes, no heuristics that hide a symptom.
- Run the unit tests, and a full build if you touched overrides.
- Smoke test: boot `h001` and one level you changed something in.
- Open it as a draft and say plainly what you tested and what you didn't.

## Claude Code skills

`.claude/skills/` has step-by-step guides that Claude Code loads, readable by anyone: `hle-divergence-debug`
(graphics and state bugs), `game-logic-debug` (60 fps, timing and gameplay bugs, dev menu, postool),
`manual-yn-bisect` (yes/no visual bisects, the fix-only PR workflow) and `audio-debug` (crackle, clicks, fuzz).
